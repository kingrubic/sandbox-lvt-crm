# LVT CRM — Claude Code Instructions

## Scope and operating boundaries

- Work only inside this repository. Never scan `/Users/vsc_agent`, the user home, sibling workspaces, or unrelated projects.
- Start with `git status --short`. Preserve unrelated dirty and untracked files.
- Never modify or commit `ios-uikit-lvt.zip`, archives, `.derivedData`, runtime caches, logs, secrets, credentials, or local environment files.
- Do not read macOS Keychain, `.env*`, token stores, OAuth data, private backups, or files outside this repository unless the owner explicitly asks for a narrowly scoped operational task.
- Do not commit, push, deploy, restart services, delete external data, or change production configuration unless explicitly requested.
- If discovery is needed, inspect this repository only. Prefer targeted file reads/searches over broad filesystem scans.

## Project map

- Web: React 19 + Vite under `src/`.
- Backend: self-hosted Convex under `convex/`.
- Private file gateway and production static server: `scripts/serve-production.mjs` plus `scripts/lib/`.
- Standalone native UIKit app: `ios-uikit-lvt/` (`vn.lvt.crm.uikit`).
- Existing SwiftUI workspace: `ios-app/`; preserve it unless the task explicitly targets it.
- Android app: `android-app/`; touch only when explicitly in scope.
- Any Android / iOS UIKit change must bump the Profile version (`versionName` / `MARKETING_VERSION`) and build number. See `.cursor/rules/native-app-version.mdc`.
- Tests: Node test runner under `tests/*.test.mjs`.
- Production frontend: `https://lvt.vscgroup.io.vn`.
- Convex runs on Convex Cloud (dev `decisive-puma-318` = sandbox, prod `confident-guanaco-953` = customers). Deploy/codegen only through `scripts/lvt-convex-cloud-env.sh` (the npm scripts); never expose or inline deploy/admin keys. The old self-hosted wrapper is retired because `127.0.0.1:3210` now belongs to another project.
- Cursor agents also load `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` (core + import always-on; work/auth rules by glob). Keep those rules in sync when changing invariants.

## Engineering discipline

1. Read the relevant implementation, schema, tests, and call sites before editing.
2. State assumptions when the source does not establish a business rule; do not invent one.
3. Make the smallest coherent change and preserve unrelated work.
4. Backend authorization and invariants are the source of truth. UI visibility is only UX and never sufficient enforcement.
5. Treat external storage, database state, cache state, and client state as separate failure domains.
6. Prefer staged operations, atomic publication, soft-delete, and compensating cleanup over destructive in-place flows.
7. Do not report completion without real tests/builds and relevant end-to-end verification.
8. Never fabricate command output, deployment state, live behavior, or test results.

## Authorization and privacy invariants

- `admin` and `moderator` are operational managers; only `admin` has supreme settings/account authority.
- Homeroom **Giám thị** is menu access `supervisor` on `homeroom` only — never a fourth `users.role`. Create/update of permission groups must reject `supervisor` on any other menu with `INVALID_MENU_ACCESS`. Legacy `edit` normalizes to `view` and must not be reused as Giám thị. `supervisor` makes the homeroom menu visible but does not satisfy generic `view_all` checks or grant another module.
- Do not disable, delete, or demote the last active admin (`LAST_ACTIVE_ADMIN`).
- Login failures stay distinct and blocking: invalid credentials, `ACCOUNT_LOCKED`, `USER_NOT_ACTIVE`.
- `loginLockedAt` is enforced at sign-in **and** on authenticated calls (`currentUserOrThrow`).
- Forgot-password sends email **before** rotating credentials. Mail failure must not leave an unknown password. Per-user cooldown only; do not add IP rate limits.
- Profile password change requires `currentPassword`. The forced `mustChangePassword` gate (web / Android / iOS) only sends `newPassword`.
- Work access requires an active account with no pending mandatory password change. Ordinary users also require the `work` menu not to be hidden.
- Work-document create/update/delete operations require the operational-manager `work:write` gate.
- Every protected Convex mutation/query must re-check authorization server-side.
- Every private-file metadata/download request must authenticate and authorize the current user.
- Never put bearer tokens, OAuth tokens, Drive IDs intended to remain private, passwords, or secrets in public URLs, logs, source, bundles, commits, or error messages.
- Cached file content is never public. Authorization is checked before serving server cache and before clients reuse local cache.
- A revoked session or removed file permission must not be bypassed by browser/iOS cache.

## Work-document business invariants

- Admin/mod may edit or delete a work document only while `approvedByUserIds` is empty.
- `pending`, `rejected`, and overdue documents remain editable/deletable only when nobody has approved.
- The first approval permanently locks editing and deletion, even when:
  - another approver is still pending;
  - aggregate `status` remains `pending`;
  - the deadline later passes.
- Reject is allowed only while `approvedByUserIds` is empty (`canRejectWorkDocument`). A later reject would leave the document both rejected and immutable.
- Do not implement the lock using only `status === "approved"`. Use the shared policy in `convex/workDocumentPolicy.ts`.
- Approvers must be active **non-admin, non-moderator** users at position level 4 or above. Operational managers manage documents; they cannot be designated approvers (`ADMIN_USE_MANAGEMENT`).
- Completing or reviewing work/personal tasks requires the parent document to still be `active` and `status === "approved"`.
- Editing a mutable document resets prior approval/rejection decisions and sends the revised document through approval again.
- Replacing assignments deactivates superseded work items/personal tasks and creates the new active work graph atomically with the document update.
- Deletion is soft-delete first. Once inactive, authorization must deny access even if Drive/cache cleanup is delayed.
- File replacement is staged: upload and validate the new file before publishing metadata. Never delete the old Drive file before the database update succeeds.
- Superseded Drive files are removed through purpose-scoped cleanup jobs. Keep `work` and `people-review` cleanup authorization separate.
- Department and individual assignees must be active, assignment deadlines use `YYYY-MM-DD`, and duplicate department assignments are invalid.
- New files must pass the shared extension allowlist, be non-empty, and remain within the 20 MiB limit.
- Preserve the legacy Convex Storage compatibility/migration path. New work uploads use private Drive storage, but existing `fileId` records are still valid until explicitly migrated.

## Private file and cache invariants

- New work uploads are private Google Drive objects; Convex stores identity/checksum/metadata, not public Drive links.
- Never return Drive links or Convex `storage.getUrl()` to the browser. Preview/download always go through `/api/files/:documentId` after authorization.
- Legacy `fileId` (Convex Storage) uses the same authorized gateway and 24-hour server cache as Drive objects.
- Prefer SHA-256 checksum as `fileVersion`; fallback is Drive identity plus size, or `convex-storage:{fileId}:{size}` for unmigrated files.
- Upload prewarm copies the already received file into shared server cache. It is best-effort: cache failure must not turn a valid Drive upload/database commit into a failed business operation.
- Shared cache remains authorize-first, atomic, bounded by TTL/size, single-flight, and concurrency-limited.
- Do not cache failed, partial, empty, unauthorized, forbidden, or not-found responses.
- Each web/iOS preview of a private work file must first call the authenticated no-store metadata endpoint and compare `fileVersion`.
- A matching version may use device/browser cache. A changed version must download and replace the local copy. Failed authorization/version checks must not fall back to stale local content.
- Metadata responses are `private, no-store`. Cacheable content responses are private, use ETag/revalidation, and vary by `Authorization`; authorization still runs before a `304` response.
- Browser metadata failure removes related Cache API entries. UIKit cache identity includes `documentId` plus `fileVersion`, uses staged writes, rejects empty files, is excluded from backup, and remains TTL/LRU bounded.
- Updating/deleting a Drive object invalidates related shared cache entries. Cleanup failure must not reactivate an inactive document.
- Do not weaken these metadata/content cache semantics without a security review.

## Upload and cleanup safety

- Preserve staged-upload settlement semantics: once the Convex mutation commits, retry settlement without repeating the business mutation.
- If the business mutation definitively did not commit, clean up the staged upload.
- Cleanup endpoints must be purpose-scoped and authorize the exact cleanup job/object.
- Never use a broad fallback from one module's authorization to another module.
- Drive downloads retry only transient network/rate-limit failures with bounded exponential backoff and jitter; never retry authorization/not-found failures as if they were transient.
- A cleanup failure after upload registration fails must not replace or hide the original registration error.
- Derive download MIME/disposition from the validated filename rather than client/storage MIME claims; preserve `nosniff` and sandboxed content policy.
- Do not make optional maintenance work a prerequisite for a successful core transaction.

## Generated code and schema

- Treat `convex/_generated/` as generated output; do not hand-edit it.
- Schema/function changes must typecheck and, when deployment/codegen is explicitly requested, use repository scripts:
  - `npm run typecheck:convex-codegen`
  - `npm run convex:dev -- --once` (dev)
  - `LVT_CONVEX_CONFIRM_PROD=confident-guanaco-953 npm run convex:deploy -- -y` (prod; clean worktree of the reviewed commit only)
- Never run a Convex deploy merely to make generated files change unless deployment is in scope.

## Required verification

For web/backend/server changes, run:

```bash
npm test
npm run build:production
git diff --check
```

For standalone UIKit changes, also run from `ios-uikit-lvt/`:

```bash
xcodebuild -project LvtCrmUIKit.xcodeproj -scheme LvtCrmUIKit \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' \
  -configuration Debug \
  -derivedDataPath /tmp/lvt-uikit-build \
  build CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

Additional rules:

- Run focused tests first when useful, then the full required gate.
- A simulator build validates compilation/configuration, not APNs or physical-device behavior.
- For live/deployment tasks, verify health, live hashed assets/routes, authorization failure behavior, and the actual changed workflow before reporting success.
- Before finishing, show `git status --short`, confirm `ios-app` was untouched unless explicitly scoped, and report remaining risks honestly.

## Trao đổi hub (web)

- Sidebar **Trao đổi** (`/trao-doi`) sits above Lịch công tác and Công việc and is visible to every active signed-in user. Work/duty threads still use the existing access rules; groups are membership-based. Admin (`role === admin`) may view and dissolve any group.
- Do not scan `workMessages` / `dutyMessages` to build the conversation list. Maintain `chatThreads` + per-user `chatInbox` (index `by_user_active_activity`) and `chatCounters` on send, recall, and group membership changes. Message history stays paginated on the existing per-entity indexes.
- Popup Trao đổi on Công tác/Công việc and the hub read the same message tables. Bell items `work_chat` / `duty_chat` / `group_chat` open the hub thread. `chatHubSync` is a one-time backfill cursor for threads that existed before the hub; new messages update the inbox directly.
- Group owner adds/removes/renames/dissolves. Members may leave (owner leave transfers to the earliest remaining member, or dissolves if nobody remains). Recall window stays 15 minutes.

## Bulk user import invariants (SYS-011)

Canonical product detail lives in `README.md` → **Import user hàng loạt**. Do not weaken these rules without owner confirmation:

- Admin-only; bulk create **`user` role only** (never admin/moderator).
- Excel `.xlsx` only, ≤ 2 MiB. Columns: `ho_ten`, `email`, `ma_phong_ban`, `ma_chuc_vu`, `ma_nhom_quyen`, `mat_khau_tam_thoi`.
- **Upload to Convex Storage first**, then server parse/validate/commit from that `uploadId`. Never trust client-supplied rows for commit.
- Keep staged files **1 hour** (success or validation failure), then purge. Validate/commit must also reject when `Date.now() > expiresAt` or the stored blob exceeds 2 MiB.
- Commit is single-use (`committed` / `committing`). Never trust client-supplied rows.
- All-or-nothing validation; preview only when every row is valid; duplicate emails (file + active/disabled-non-rollback DB) block import.
- Mid-batch failure soft-disables created rows (`importRollbackAt`); a retry may reactivate those emails. Ordinary disabled accounts still block.
- Duplicate active catalog codes block import.
- Entity codes (department / position / permission group): ≤20, `A–Z0–9_-`, stored uppercase; case-insensitive match on import.
- Soft-delete catalogs; **block delete while users are assigned**; recreate with same **code** reactivates.

## Bulk user export invariants (SYS-012)

Canonical detail: `README.md` → **Xuất danh sách người dùng**.

- Admin-only client-side `.xlsx` of **active** users only; never export role or password.
- Headers use Vietnamese diacritics (office use, not re-import).
- Admin/moderator rows: empty permission-group code, name `Quản trị viên`.
- Filename `danh_sach_nguoi_dung_YYYYMMDD_NN.xlsx` with daily browser counter reset.

## How to ask questions

- First answer questions that the repository source, tests, schema, README, or this file can resolve.
- Ask the owner only when a business/product decision is genuinely missing or conflicting.
- Group unresolved questions by impact: blocking, security/data integrity, then UX/non-blocking.
- Do not silently choose a destructive, irreversible, permission-expanding, or privacy-weakening interpretation.
